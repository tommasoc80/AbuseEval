The inter-annotator agreement of AbuseEval has been conducted by three annotators: 1 man (38, Italian) and 2 women (39, Serbian; 23, Russian); all highly educated, with a background in computational linguistics, and familiar with Twitter. The full annotation of AbuseEval has been conducted by one annotator (23, Russian), highly educated and with a background in computational linguistics.
